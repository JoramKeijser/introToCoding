### Intro to coding - Hangman game

Use the hangman_game.m script as a template to live code with the in2science students!

With this example you can cover:
- coding window / command window / workspace
- variables
- types of variables (cell, characters, numbers)
- for and while loops
- indexing into variables
- displaying text in the command window
- clearing / re-defining variables

Generating the word bank is an easy and interactive part of the tutorial - be sure to ask for neuroscience / lab related words!

See codingIntro.md for a template structure.

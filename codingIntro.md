# Coding basics 

## Variables (& redefining)
Variables are containers for storing data values. In MATLAB, you can create and redefine variables easily:

in2science
in2science = 1;                  % Assign a number
in2science = 'awesome';          % Reassign with a string (word)

## Indexing & more variables 
MATLAB uses parentheses () for indexing. Indexing starts at 1, not 0.

in2science(2)                    % Get the 2nd character of the string
in2science = {'abc', 'bcd', 'cde'}; % Create a cell array of strings: suing students names is good here 
in2science(2)                    % Get the 2nd cell (returns {'bcd'})
in2science{2}(1)                 % Get the 1st character of the 2nd cell (returns 'b')

## Functions
MATLAB has many built-in functions. Here are two common ones:

length(in2science)               % Returns the length of an array or string
input('Enter something: ');      % Prompts user for input

## If/for/while loops
Control structures help you control the flow of your program:

for i = 1:6                      % Loop from 1 to 6
    disp(in2science{i})          % Display each element (will error if less than 6 elements)
end

## Finding functions
When you need help or can't remember a function (or anything else):
 - Use MATLAB's help(): e.g., help length
 - Google your question: "MATLAB how to..."
 - Ask an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude) for explanations or examples

# Coding hangman

## Writing pseudocode / algorithm:
Pseudocode is a plain language description of your program's steps. Here's an example for Hangman:

(to add later: Print welcome message and instructions)

Set word to guess
Set lives to x
Create empty word spaces
Create empty guessed letters list

While lives > 0:
    (to add later: Print remaining lives)
    Ask player to guess a letter
    
    If letter in word:
        Update word spaces
        Print "Correct guess"
    Else:
        Decrease lives by 1
    
    Add letter to guessed letters list
    Print current word spaces
    (to add later: Print all letters guessed)

    If word fully guessed:
        Print "You won!"
        Ask to play again
        Break loop
    
    If lives = 0:
        Print "Game over"
        Reveal word
        Ask to play again
        Break loop

End game

## Now translate into code (live) 
(This section would be filled during a live coding session)

## What is missing? 

### Printing information: number of lives left, current guesses, ...
Use the disp() function to show game state:
    disp(['Lives left: ' num2str(lives)])
    disp(['Current word: ' current_word_state])
    disp(['Guessed letters: ' guessed_letters])

### Drawing hangman
You can represent the hangman visually using ASCII art. Here's an example:

HANGMANPICS = {
    ['      ' newline ...
     '      ' newline ...
     '      ' newline ...
     '      ' newline ...
     '      ' newline ...
     '      ' newline ...
     '========='],

    ['      ' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    ['  ---+' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     ' O   |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     ' O   |' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     ' O   |' newline ...
     '/|   |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     ' O   |' newline ...
     '/|\  |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     ' O   |' newline ...
     '/|\  |' newline ...
     '/    |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '========='],

    [' +---+' newline ...
     ' |   |' newline ...
     ' O   |' newline ...
     '/|\  |' newline ...
     '/ \  |' newline ...
     '     |' newline ...
     '=========']
};

To use this in your game, you would display the appropriate picture based on the number of lives left:
disp(HANGMANPICS{11 - lives})  % Assuming you start with 10 lives

# In practice
## How to get started coding
    - tutorials
    - AdventOfCode game
    - Git and Github (show this repo!)
    - StackOverflow / reddit / ...
    - LLM! As we just saw, you can iterate with an LLM to help you get started / iron out some bugs and explain them to you. Use it like your own personal teacher. 
## How we use coding in neuroscience
If there's time, bring up GUI of neurons PSTHS aligned to stimulus onset. For one neuron, how can we test whether it responds to one stimulus (.e.g gratings - talk about Hubel and Weisel Nobel Prize - we can do the same analysis here!)
